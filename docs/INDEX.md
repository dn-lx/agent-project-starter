## Durable decisions

- `docs/adr/0001-agent-independent-engineering.md` — accepted baseline architecture decision.
- New durable architecture decisions use `docs/templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md`.

## Templates

Templates are reference material; load only the one needed:

- `docs/templates/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/VERIFICATION-EVIDENCE-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/REVIEW-PACKET-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/RELEASE-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/OPERATIONS-RUNBOOK-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/ANALYTICS-EVENT-CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/FRONTEND-VISUAL-QA-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/PLAYWRIGHT-VISUAL-SANITY.md`
- `docs/templates/MCP-PROFILE-EXAMPLE.md`
- `docs/templates/ROUTING-PROFILE-EXAMPLE.md`
- `docs/templates/PROJECT-SKILL-TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/LEARNING-PROPOSAL-TEMPLATE.md`

Agent-skill discovery is separate: use `.agents/SKILL-INDEX.md`.

## Maintenance

Run `node scripts/validate-docs.mjs` to check documentation structure/references. After adapting the starter into a real project, run `node scripts/validate-docs.mjs --strict-project` to find starter placeholders that should have been replaced.
